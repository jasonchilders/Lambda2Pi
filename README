A project for exploring conversion of lambda-calculus terms to pi-calculus processes.

Requirements for running Lambda2Pi.py
1. /usr/local/bin/python3 should be available (might work on python 2, but tested against python3)

2. To run, type the following at the cmdline:
    a. $ ./Lambda2Pi --help
or
    b. $ python3 Lambda2Pi --help

This will give you an idea of how to execute the program.
